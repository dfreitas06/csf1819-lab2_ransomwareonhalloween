# Ransomware on Halloween

### Forensics Cyber-Security - Lab 2

This assignment consists in analysing artifacts and search for evidence of the action of a virus in a System as well as reverting such actions.

Sally Jones is a PhD student working on molecular biology. Her research is about finding a cure for a specific type of cancer. A couple of days after the Halloween day in 2018, while she was intensely working on her next paper submission (which was due in less than a week), a pop-up window has suddenly appeared on her laptop’s screen. 

All of her precious work encrypted and potentially lost? She couldn’t believe what was happening! To check if this message was for real, she opened a terminal and listed the folders where she kept images of human cancer cells, along with the main draft of her paper. In the list, she confirmed the existence of the original filenames along with a set of new files named after the original filenames with an extra prefix “.encrypted”.

In order to get help, she hired a forensic analyst by the name of Ted Silver who told her immediately, on the phone, to stop making any changes to her computer. In particular, he told her to leave the pop-up message open and to not power down or suspend her laptop. Ted visited Sally, interviewed her, and collected several digital artifacts for further analysis in the lab.
